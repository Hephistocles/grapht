\section{Graph Databases}

TODO: Invention

TODO: separate from graph processing (e.g. Pregel, based on BSP) [c.f. OLAP and OLTP]

TODO: Comment that problem is common enough for people to have developed in-house solution (FB open Graph, Google Knowledge Graph, Twitter FlockDB)

TODO: Benefit of graph DB is traversals are localised and do not have to take into account unrelated data
		Obviously this can be a disadvantage

TODO: Intro to Neo4j


\section{Relational Databases}

TODO: RDBMS has been around for a while - more stable, provides better ACID guarantees
	Generally people are more invested in an older system, and reluctant to change!

TODO: Intro to PostgreSQL

\section{Related Work}

TODO: see main.bib 

TODO: Mention ORMs which have a similar aim to make RDBMS relations feel more natural (but don't
generally improve performance in the same way Grapht does)

% Definitely mention Crackle somehow to show the starting point of the project
% But say "Previous work has shown these results, which we [sort of] replicate
% here" and make sure to be clear we wrote all code ourselves! (Eiko might not
% know that).
