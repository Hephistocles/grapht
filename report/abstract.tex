\vspace{24pt} 


There has recently been an increasing need for fast analysis of
graph-structured data, which has led to the development of several
graph-centric alternatives to traditional relational databases. Although these
ensure the fast execution of queries which fit within this graph-centric model,
inevitably a compromise has been made, and other queries perform less
efficiently than they would have done with a relational database. I propose the
development of a query language enabling intelligent dispatch of optimised
queries either directly to a relational database, or through a graph-centric
query processing layer.
